# Gaussian Mixture Model Sampler Configuration
# Based on CL-Splats paper Algorithm 1, 2, and 3

# Number of K-Means clusters for region-based sampling
num_clusters: 10

# Number of samples to generate per sampling round

# Maximum number of sampling rounds
max_rounds: 10

# Minimum number of points in changed region to use region-based sampling
# If fewer points exist, use full-scene sampling instead
