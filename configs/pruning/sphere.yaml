# Sphere Pruning Configuration
# 
# This configuration defines parameters for sphere-based pruning
# as described in the CL-Splats paper.

# Minimum number of points required to form a cluster
# Smaller values create more fine-grained spheres
# Larger values create fewer, larger spheres
min_cluster_size: 1000

# Quantile for radius calculation (0-1)
# Uses the Nth percentile of distances from cluster center
# 0.98 means the sphere will contain 98% of cluster points
quantile: 0.98

# Safety multiplier for sphere radius
# Adds a margin to prevent premature pruning
# 1.1 means 10% larger than the quantile distance
radius_multiplier: 1.1

# Pruning frequency (in iterations)
# How often to check and prune Gaussians
# Default: 15 (as per paper)
prune_every: 15
